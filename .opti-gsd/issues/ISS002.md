# ISS002: Documentation refers to opti-gsd as "plugin" instead of CLI tool

**Reported:** 2026-01-25
**Severity:** medium
**Status:** resolved
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25

## Description

opti-gsd is now installed via `npx opti-gsd`, not as a Claude Code plugin. Documentation still refers to it as a "plugin" in many places.

## What to Change

**Change:** References to opti-gsd being a "plugin" → "CLI tool" or "workflow tool"

**Keep:**
- References to OTHER plugins (plugin-dev, etc.)
- The `.claude-plugin/` directory structure (Claude Code still uses this)
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable (still valid)

## Files to Update

1. `CLAUDE.md` - Line 3: "plugin repository" → "repository"
2. `.opti-gsd/codebase/codebase.md` - Multiple lines
3. `README.md` - Line 114 reference to plugins
4. Various command files where opti-gsd is called "this plugin"

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] opti-gsd is not referred to as a "plugin" (except in .claude-plugin/ context)
- [ ] Installation instructions reference `npx opti-gsd`
- [ ] Other plugins (plugin-dev) still correctly called plugins
