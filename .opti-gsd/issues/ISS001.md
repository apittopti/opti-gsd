# ISS001: Next steps commands not clickable (inside code blocks)

**Reported:** 2026-01-25
**Severity:** medium
**Status:** resolved
**Resolved:** 2026-01-25

## Description

Commands in "Next steps:" sections are inside markdown code blocks, making them non-clickable in terminal output. Users cannot click to execute suggested commands.

## Root Cause

The output templates wrap entire completion messages in markdown code blocks:
```markdown
```markdown
## Phase Complete!
...
Next steps:
→ /opti-gsd:verify  ← NOT CLICKABLE (inside code block)
```                  ← code block closes AFTER commands
```

## Fix

Close the code block BEFORE the "Next steps:" section:

```markdown
```markdown
## Phase Complete!
...
```                  ← close code block HERE

Next steps:
→ /opti-gsd:verify  ← NOW CLICKABLE (outside code block)
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All "Next steps:" sections are outside code blocks
- [ ] Commands like `/opti-gsd:verify` are clickable in terminal
- [ ] Output formatting still looks correct
